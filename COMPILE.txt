OpenDCP
------------
This program builds the XML files for Digital Cinema Packages. 

Requirements
------------
The program requires the following libraries. The versions listed are the ones tested with OpenDCP.
Other versions may work, except where indicated.

*   Optional, if you want XML signatures
**  OpenDCP .20 uses locally compile version of these libraries 
*** Optional, if you want to compile the GUI

Mac OS X and many linux distributions already have OpenSSL (libcrypto) installed.

Cmake
------------
CMake is used to build this application. You may need to install CMake.
Most linux distributions have CMake installed or have it available through the package manager.
On Mac OSX and Windows, CMake is easily installed from http://www.cmake.org/

Compile
------------
It is recommended you perform an out-of-source build. This will prevent cluttering the source directory.
This can be performed from anywhere, just give cmake the path to the root directory of the OpenDCP source.

For example, if the OpenDCP source is in /home/opendcp, but you want to build in /home/opendcp-build

$ cd /home/opendcp-build
$ cmake /home/opendcp/

By default XMLSEC libraries are enabled, but to simplify compiling you can disable it. 

$ cmake -DENABLE_XMLSEC=OFF /home/opendcp

If you wish to compile the GUI (see note below), enable the GUI flag

$ cmake -DENABLE_GUI=ON /home/opendcp

Once cmake completes, you should have the necessary make files. To compile issue the make command.

$ make

You should end up with opendcp_xml, opendcp_xml, opendc_xml_verify (if XMLSEC enabled) opendcp_j2k
in the cli directory of the build tree.

GUI 
------------
If you wish to compile the GUI, you will need install QT4 development and runtime
libraries (4.7 or higher). On Linux you can usually install this through the package manager. 
Otherwise, you can download it from http://qt.nokia.com/.

GUI compiling is enabled by default, to disable it pass -DENABLE_GUI=OFF to cmake.

Install
------------
You can install OpenDCP so you can invoke the command from anywhere. The behavior of where
the binaries are installed varies between OSes.

# make install

Packages
------------
You can also create package/installers. Windows and OSX are detected automatically,
but when compiling under linux you need to specify whether you want DEB or RPMS. This
is done by passing -DRPM=ON or -DDEB=ON during the initial cmake.

To then build the package:

# make package
